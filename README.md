# JSON Utils

This vscode extension including some coolest features to manipulate JSON. For example: validate | beautify | uglify | escape | unescape | fix etc.

## Features

As there are tons of vscode extensions with similar features out there but I still cannot find one of them can be fulfilled all of my requirements. Therefore, I would like make a all in one solution instead of many dependency with overlapping features.
